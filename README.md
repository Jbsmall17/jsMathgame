# A_Math_Game
This project draws inspiration from mathematics and is developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The core of the project is an interactive game designed to assess your multiplication proficiency. It accomplishes this by presenting a question involving two randomly generated numbers with a multiplication operator. The game then populates the answer box with one correct answer and three incorrect options. Successfully answering the question results in a score increment. Feel free to explore the game and enjoy determining how high you can push your score. Give it a try and have some fun!
